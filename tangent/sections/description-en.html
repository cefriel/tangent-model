<span class="markdown">

The definition of the TANGENT Reference Conceptual Model is based on
the analysis of data standards requested by the European
Commission (EC) Delegated Regulations (DR) supplementing the ITS
Directive 2010/40/EU:

-   DR EU No. 886/2013 -- Safety Related Traffic Information (SRTI);

-   DR EU No 2015/962 -- Real-time Traffic Information (RTTI);

-   DR EU 2017/1926 -- Multimodal Traffic Information Service (MMTIS).

The data standards mentioned in these directives are:

-   **[DATEX II](https://www.datex2.eu/)**: the EU standard for the exchange of
    traffic-related data;

-   **[NeTEx](https://netex-cen.eu/)**: the CEN Technical Standard for exchanging Public
    Transport schedules and related data;

-   **[SIRI](https://www.siri-cen.eu/)**: the CEN technical standard for the exchange of
    real-time information about the planned, current, or projected
    performance of public transport operations.

Each data standard supports the exchange of a specific set of
mobility-related information. In the following, a list of information
exchanges supported by each standard is reported:

-   DATEX II: traffic situations, traffic status, traffic management,
    Messages displayed on Variable Message Signs (VMS), service
    information, parking, truck parking, urban traffic specifics,
    electromobility infrastructure, refuelling and recharging,
    management of electronic traffic regulations, and urban vehicle
    access regulations.

-   NeTEx: public transport network topologies, public transport
    scheduled timetables, and public transport fares.

-   SIRI: real-time information about schedules, vehicles, and
    connections, together with general informational messages related to
    the operation of the services.

<h3 id="ontologies" class="list">Reused ontologies</h3>
<span class="markdown">
To support the definition of the TANGENT Reference Conceptual Model, the
existing ontologies encoding the semantics of the mentioned standards
have been analysed.

Considering the DATEX II format, we selected for reuse the ontology directly developed by the DATEX II
organization and presented in 2021 at the DATEX II 6th Forum. It represents a JSON-LD serialisation of the DATEX II conceptual
model version 3 and is divided into five modules:
-   *Payload* module (https://datex2.eu/vocab/3/D2Payload/)
-   *Common* module (https://datex2.eu/vocab/3/Common/)
-   *Location Referencing* module (https://datex2.eu/vocab/3/LocationReferencing/)
-   *Situation* module (https://datex2.eu/vocab/3/Situation/)
-   *Road Traffic Data* module (https://datex2.eu/vocab/3/RoadTrafficData/)
-   *Variable Message* Sign module (https://datex2.eu/vocab/3/Vms/)

The advantage of this model is its full coverage with respect to the DATEX II
specification, the one-to-one mapping to classes and properties, and the
fact that it is directly defined and published by the DATEX II
organization. However, the model is defined as an almost automatic
conversion of the DATEX II specification, thus introducing some objectionable design
decision from an ontological point of view. For this reason, additional usage guidelines regulate the adoption of the
ontology in the TANGENT Reference Conceptual Model:
- basic datatypes values that can be represented through RDF
    Literals will be represented as such, not instantiating the
    datatypes classes (e.g., Boolean) defined by DATEX II;
- geographical information may be represented by exploiting relevant
    ontologies such as the [Basic Geo](https://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/) (WGS84 lat/long) Vocabulary,
    [GeoSPARQL](http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#), or the dedicated vocabularies defined by the [LOD
    SRTI DATEX II](https://cef.uv.es/lodroadtran18/def/transporte/dtx_srti) ontology (e.g., Alert-C) to improve
    interoperability with other modules of the TANGENT Reference
    Conceptual Model.

The NeTEx and SIRI standards are based on the [Transmodel](https://www.transmodel-cen.eu/standards/) conceptual
model. The Mobility Ontology Catalogue (https://w3id.org/mobility) defines a suite of
ontologies based on existing standards, including a Transmodel ontology. 

The Transmodel ontology (https://w3id.org/mobility/transmodel) defines five submodules:
-   *Core* module (https://w3id.org/mobility/transmodel/core)
-   *Commons* module (https://w3id.org/mobility/transmodel/commons>)
-   *Fares* module (https://w3id.org/mobility/transmodel/facilities)
-   *Facilities* module (https://w3id.org/mobility/transmodel/fares)
-   *Journeys* module (https://w3id.org/mobility/transmodel/journeys)

As for modules based on NeTEx, many classes and properties that revolve
around stop points and public transport schedules and lines could be
found in the Transmodel ontology. The [DCI Metadata Terms](http://purl.org/dc/terms/) and [Schema.org](https://schema.org/) vocabularies are reused
by the Transmodel ontology and similarly also in other TANGENT Reference Conceptual Model modules.

An ontological version of the SIRI standard did not
exist, thus we developed a dedicated ontology representing concepts and
relations mapped from SIRI and considered as relevant to TANGENT's
requirements. For the design of the ontology, we adopted an approach
aligned to the one leveraged for the definition of the DATEX II JSON-LD
ontology from the DATEX II specification. Therefore, we did not follow a
classic ontology engineering process starting from scratch, but we
adapted the existing SIRI specification to an ontological format.
Moreover, we manually curated the SIRI ontology to improve the alignment
with the other ontologies adopted in the TANGENT Reference Conceptual
Model. We implemented the ontology and we published it online fulfilling the best practices for
ontology implementation and publication. The ontology is available at
[https://knowledge.c-innovationhub.com/siri\#](https://knowledge.c-innovationhub.com/siri)
(preferred prefix *siri:*).

The TANGENT Reference Conceptual Model is complemented by the definition
of custom classes and properties covering gaps in the existing
ontologies and specific requirements of the considered use case.
Specifically, the definition of a few datatype properties, with XSD data
types as range, was needed for replacing the DATEX II object properties
linking to its custom datatype classes (e.g. *Boolean, Float, Date,*
etc.). For instance, the DATEX II object property
*predefinedItineraryName* has the class *MultilingualString* as range,
while we create a custom datatype property *predefinedItineraryName*
with the data type *string* as range. As another example, the original
object property *overrunning* links a *Validity* to the class *Boolean*,
and we replace it with the datatype property *overrunning* with the data
type *boolean* as range. In other cases, we created new classes,
properties and named individuals when we could not find them in the
reused ontologies, as in the case of the module of the TANGENT Reference
Conceptual Model dedicated to *Road Equipment*, or the property to
indicate whether a point included in an itinerary is the last one
*(isLastPoint*)*.* Finally, new object properties like *hasPoint* have
been introduced to link classes reused from different ontologies (in
this case, the class *PointLocation* from DATEX II and the class *Point*
from Basic Geo).

<h3 id="defnition" class="list">Definition of the TANGENT Reference Conceptual Model</h3>
<span class="markdown">  

Based on the analysis performed, the TANGENT Reference Conceptual Model
was defined as a suite of ontologies considering the semantics of
relevant EU-mandated standards and the already available related
ontologies. The definition of the TANGENT Reference Conceptual Model has
been guided by the requirements elicited for the harmonisation and
fusion of data sources from the TANGENT case studies. Indeed, TANGENT
does not aim to define a fully comprehensive suite of ontologies to
describe the entire transportation domain but to identify and extend the
ones needed to cover the TANGENT data requirements. Table 2 provides a
complete overview of the ten different modules defined for the TANGENT
Reference Conceptual Model. The table summarises for each module the
base standard considered for identifying the semantics of concepts and
relationships, the TANGENT Data Requirements covered
by the module, and the already available ontologies reused in each
module.

For data about traffic and weather, the DATEX II standard, thus the
DATEX ontology, has been used and extended. The main two concepts common
to all the reused portions of the model are:

-   *ElaboratedDataPublication*: a publication containing one or more
    elaborated data, linked to a *PhysicalQuantity* that has been
    measured or calculated.

-   *BasicData*: the data that are either measured or calculated at the
    same time (period), which are further specialized as *TrafficData,
    WeatherData, TravelTimeData,* and so on.

Two additional concepts used multiple times across the TANGENT Reference
Conceptual Model are: *ItineraryByReference* and
*MeasurementOrCalculationTime*.

An *ItineraryByReference* is a set of multiple ordered locations defined
by reference to a *PredefinedItinerary*, which is in turn linked to the
individual locations contained in the actual itinerary
(*haslocationContainedInItinerary).* For representing the latitude and
longitude associated with each *PointLocation* within the itinerary we
reuse the [Basic Geo](https://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/) ontology.

</span>
<p align="center"><img src="./sections/media/image2.png" alt="Model for an itinerary" height="200"></p>
<span class="markdown">

The class *MeasurementOrCalculationTime* describes the time
(*timeValue)* at which a measurement or calculation of a (set of)
value(s) was performed, indicating whether it is the beginning,
intermediate or ending time. The time is expressed in the form of a time
*Period*, with a start and an end date.

</span>
<p align="center"><img src="./sections/media/image2.png" alt="Model for a measurement or calculation time" height="200"></p>
<span class="markdown">

The **Road Transport Network** module leverages the class *NamedArea* to represent an area defined by a name
(*areaName*) and linked to a *country*, which is expressed using the EN
ISO 3166-1 two-character country code. Such named area can be of
different types (*namedAreaType),* like *trafficArea* or *lake*. The
[GeoSPARQL](http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql\#) ontology is reused for linking the named area to its
*Geometry*, which is in turn linked to multiple *Points* when the
geometry is of type *Polygon*.

</span>
<p align="center"><img src="./sections/media/image3.png" alt="Model for the Road Transport Network module" height="300"></p>
<span class="markdown">

The **Road Travel Times** module models data about the derived or computed travel
time (datatype property *travelTime*) by referring to a linear section of
the road network. Other three datatype properties express the travel
time that is normally expected for the given period
(*normallyExpectedTravelTime*), the travel time which would be expected
under ideal free-flow conditions (*freeFlowTravelTime*), and the delay
compared to free-flow conditions (*travelTimeDelay*). Moreover, the
*TravelTimeData* is linked to the current trend in the travel time
between two locations (*decreasing, increasing* or *stable*) and is
typed (*travelTimeType*) based on how it was derived (e.g., *estimated,
best, sum,* and so on).

</span>
<p align="center"><img src="./sections/media/image4.png" alt="Model for the Road Travel Times module" height="300"></p>
<span class="markdown">

Three specific types of *TrafficData* are identified in the **Road Traffic Data** module:
*TrafficFlow* rates (measured or normally expected), average or expected
*TrafficSpeed*, and the density of vehicles (*TrafficConcentration*).
The class *TrafficStatus* models the status of traffic conditions on a
specific section or at a specific point on the road network, which can
be heavy, slow, stationary, etc.

<p align="center"><img src="./sections/media/image5.png" alt="Model for the Road Traffic Data module" height="300"></p>

For describing road equipment, since the Datex II ontology provides little support for
this type of entities, the **Road Equipment** module define specific classes and properties or
reuse other ontologies. The diagram shows the properties defined or
selected for representing its id, name, description and type (e.g.
*trafficCounter*, *cctv*, and so on). Each individual of the
*RoadEquipment* class is linked to its *PointLocation*, with longitude
and latitude.

</span>
<p align="center"><img src="./sections/media/image6.png" alt="Model for the Road Equipment module" height="300"></p>
<span class="markdown">

The **Events** module defines how to represent different types of events. To record such information the model adopts entities from the Datex II ontologies such as *AbnormalTraffic*, *Accidents* involving one or more
vehicles, *Activities* by humans like organised *PublicEvent*s which
could disrupt traffic. Specifically, a *SituationRecord* is linked to an
itinerary (*haslocationReference*) and to the time when the information
in the record was observed (*situationRecordObservationTime*). Moreover,
it is possible to specify a *Validity* and its status and the *Cause* of
the situation, such as the presence of animals on the road or holiday
traffic.

</span>
<p align="center"><img src="./sections/media/image7.png" alt="Model for the Events module" height="450"></p>
<span class="markdown">

The **Weather Data** module identifies the most relevant classes and properties for
representing data related to the weather at a specific location or
multiple locations. Specifically, we model the measured atmospheric
humidity (*HumidityInformation*) and air temperature, along with the
maximum and minimum temperature during the measurement period
(*TemperatureInformation*). *WindInformation* includes measurements of
wind speed and the direction from which the wind blows.
*PrecipitationInformation* allows indicating whether precipitation was
present or not (*noPrecipitation*), and, if it was, to add some details
such as intensity and type (e.g. *snow, freezingRain,* etc.). Finally,
information about atmospheric *Pressure* has been modeled.

<p align="center"><img src="./sections/media/image8.png" alt="Model for the Weather Data module" height="500"></p>
<span class="markdown">

The SIRI standard semantics are selected to model
monitored vehicle journeys and situations affecting transport networks,
respectively.

In the **Vehicle Monitoring** module, a *VehicleActivity*, associated with the time at
which data about it was recorded, is linked to the journey of the
vehicle that is being monitored. Such *MonitoredVehicleJourney* is
related to elements identifying the journey, that is the reference to
the line (*lineRef*) and the direction (*directionRef*) of the journey,
and the *FramedVehicleJourneyRef*, that is a reference to the vehicle
journey that the vehicle is making. Other references specify the origin
and destination scheduled stop points, along with their names. The
property *publishedLineName* indicates the name or number by which the
line is known to the public. The *operatorRef* refers to the operator
for the current point in the journey. The class *Point* from the Basic
Geo ontology has been reused for the current geospatial location of the
vehicle. The *Occupancy*, with predefined possible values as named
individuals, allows giving an idea of how occupied the journey is after
departing from a given stop, e.g. *manySeatsAvailable* or
*standingRoomOnly*. Two additional datatype properties model the
*bearing* in which the vehicle is heading and the *delay* against the
schedule. Finally, the journey can be linked to the operational block
associated with the vehicle journey (*hasOperationalBlock).*
</span>
<p align="center"><img src="./sections/media/image9.png" alt="Model for the Vehicle Monitoring module" height="450"></p>
<span class="markdown">

In the **Situation Exchange** module, the model for public transport situations revolves around
the class *PtSituationElement*, which can be linked to many different
types of affected elements, that is, a line, an operator, a vehicle
journey, a stop point (which is linked to its point location), and, more
generally, an affected place. The situation has a *creationTime*, and it
can be planned (e.g. engineering works) or unplanned (e.g. service
alteration). Sets of specific named individuals allow the definition of
the *VerificationStatus,* i.e., whether the situation has been verified,
the source of information (*SourceType),* like email, phone, or fax, and
the cause of alert (e.g. *cableFire, policeOrder,* etc.).
</span>

The two following diagrams show how we reused and extended the Transmodel ontology in the TANGENT Reference Conceptual Model.

Specifically, in the **Stop Points** module, a *ScheduledStopPoint* is associated
with its name (*label)*, *identifier* and *publicCode*. By introducing
the property *hasStopType* we can specify the specific type of a
scheduled stop point, e.g., *onStreetBus, airport, railStation*, and so
on. The stop point is also linked to a *Location*, with its latitude and
longitude coordinates.
</span>
<p align="center"><img src="./sections/media/image11.png" alt="Model for the Stop Points module" height="300"></p>
<span class="markdown">

The **Schedules** module defines the model for public transport lines, schedules and
services. A *Line*, intended as a group of routes, is described by its
*name, identifier, description*, *publicCode* and *TransportMode.* A
line is *runBy* an *Operator*, which is linked to its contact details
(*telephone* number, *url*, and *email* address). The property
*presentedBy* links a line with its corresponding *Presentation* in a
map, with each associated *colour* that may be different from the colour
used to represent the text related to the line (*textColour)*. A
*ServiceJourney*, which is a journey made by a vehicle that carries
passengers for one specified day type, is linked to the specific *Line*
with the *refersToLine* property. Each service journey can have one or
more *Calls,* with an arrival and departure time, their order number
within the sequence of stops, and the scheduled stop point they refer
to. Finally, the service journey is linked to the *ServiceCalendar*,
with its beginning (*from*) and end (*to*), and is associated with a
*DayType,* which is a type of day characterised by one or more
properties which affect public transport operation and specifies the
*DaysofWeek*s it refers to (e.g. *Monday, Tuesday,* etc.).
